# Sensor Monitoring System

This project involves the development of a small application for monitoring sensors deployed in various locations to read temperatures. The system maintains a registry of sensors, their locations, and the corresponding temperature readings. The development process follows an iterative approach, including analysis, design, and implementation.

### Iteration 1

- **Activity:**
  - Requirements analysis
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - Domain model 

### Iteration 2

- **Activity:**
  - Requirements analysis, design, and implementation
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - Interaction diagrams (sequence and communication)
  - Class diagram 

### Iteration 3

- **Activity:**
  - Implementation in C#
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - Application code
  - Video recording 

### Iteration 4

- **Activity:**
  - Modify domain model and interaction diagrams to accommodate new requirements
  - Write complete formal specification (Z-spec)
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - Modified domain model and interaction diagrams
  - Complete formal specification 

### Iteration 5

- **Activity:**
  - OCL specifications
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - UML class diagram with OCL specifications 

### Iteration 6

- **Activity:**
  - Final implementation adding new requirements in Python
- **Artifacts Produced:**
  - Updated application code
  - Video recording
